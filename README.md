# Obsidian Title Linker Plugin

## Overview
The Title Linker Plugin for Obsidian enriches your note-taking by creating wikilink connections automatically, enhancing navigation and coherence within your digital notebook. It identifies occurrences of note titles within the text of other notes, creating links for seamless discovery of related content. Everyone wants their notes to be linked via common words and titles, but manually linking every note is time-consuming. Obsidian Title Linker automates this at the push of a button.

## Features

- **Automatic Link Creation:** Generates wikilinks across your notes, enriching your vault's interconnectedness.
- **Error Handling and Backups:** A robust backup system safeguards notes before modifications, ensuring data integrity. Care should be taken on systems with low storage, especially with large vaults, as backups require additional space.
- **Selective Processing:** Configure exclusions to control the plugin's scope, preserving the integrity of specific folders or notes.
- **Optimized Performance:** Processes all notes on the first run, then smartly targets new or updated content, streamlining subsequent operations.
- **User Confirmations:** Confirmation prompts for all significant actions prevent unintended changes.
- **Progress Notifications:** Keeps you informed from start to finish, with updates on milestones and a comprehensive summary upon completion.
- **Smart Exclusions:** Does not create links in YAML front matter or within code blocks, preserving the syntax and purpose of these sections.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Easily installable from Obsidian's community plugin directory.
2. **Configuration:** Access the plugin settings to tailor exclusions and preferences according to your needs.
3. **Initiation:** Activate the plugin through a ribbon icon or the command palette, with user confirmation ensuring deliberate action.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Vault Backup:** Always back up your vault before use, protecting against unintended modifications.
- **Exclusion List:** Utilize the exclusion list feature to safeguard specific areas of your vault from changes.
- **Initial Run Duration:** The first execution can be extensive, especially for large vaults, but is essential for establishing baseline links.
